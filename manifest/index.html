<h1> RANA WORLD</h1>
<h2>A Balanced Eco System of Information</h2>


<h3>Components</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>MULBASA</strong> - ML Project mapping the roots of words to its origin to create a simple international translator</li>
    <li><strong>SALLI</strong> - A Crypto coin that links with store value systems</li>
    <li><strong>BADDA</strong> - Law & Order Ticketing System, Spam, etc</li>
</ul>


<sort out the rest></sort>

a web with built in economy that provides a fair value exchange, bi-directional
(viewers can earn, hosts can earn,)

ultimately to be backed by its own crypto currency (tied in to a TLD???)

Sub projects (ML of word root origin mapping)

Proof of concept,

A Chrome Extension
a simple bitcoin mining grid


the mining power of a website will be considered as a function f (page loads) (a page loads of x will be matched with a hash power of X)
the viewer must both view and contribute to be counted into a function, (amount of text in a page, time spent on a page, or information uploaded) {wp}

Website owners can register a website and provide a coin address
Websites who's owners have not registered will be ad-blocked and revenue will be sent to a fund that is to be sent to a charity
