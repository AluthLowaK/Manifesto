SALLI - A Crypto coin that links with store value systems
BADDA - Law & Order Ticketing System, Spam, etc

Proof of concept,

A Chrome Extension
a simple bitcoin mining grid


the mining power of a website will be considered as a function f (page loads) (a page loads of x will be matched with a hash power of X)
the viewer must both view and contribute to be counted into a function, (amount of text in a page, time spent on a page, or information uploaded) {wp}

Website owners can register a website and provide a coin address
Websites who's owners have not registered will be ad-blocked and revenue will be sent to a fund that is to be sent to a charity
